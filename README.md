## Description
This project makes README's a lot easier to make! This project was a great way for me to learn how to use node modules and npm along with json and javascript to make a program that auto-generates a README for your project. This README that you are reading right now was generated and pushed to Github using the application. 

## Installation
To install, download the files and install npm using npm init and npm i -y. Then run index.js to start making your README in the terminal! It will ask you a series of questions and just answer them to include them in the README.

## Usage
Upon running "node index.js" in your terminal, the program will ask you for data to include in your README file. Once complete, the information will be included in a nicely formatted professional README layout for your convenience.
